You are my AI Flutter mentor and project assistant. I want you to **generate a professional README file** for my Flutter learning journey. 

The README must serve as **my learning tracker, progress monitor, and project guide**. I want to use it to track what I have learned, plan new feature branches, and show proof of my progress.

Please do the following:

1. **Project Overview**  
   - Write a short description explaining that this repository is for learning Flutter.  
   - Mention that Dart is already covered.  
   - Explain that this README will track learning progress and guide feature branch creation.

2. **Learning Goals**  
   - List my main learning goals (widgets, state management, routing, responsive UI, API integration, clean architecture, testing, etc.)

3. **Learning Checklist**  
   - Divide topics into **Basic, Intermediate, Advanced**.  
   - For each topic, include:  
     - Topic Name  
     - Short Concept Explanation  
     - Example Task or Mini Project  
     - Recommended Packages (if any)  
     - Estimated Time  
     - Status (default 🚧 in progress)  

4. **Progress Tracking Instructions**  
   - Explain how I will mark topics as ✅ completed or 🚧 in progress.  
   - Include instructions for creating **feature branches** for each topic or mini-project learned.  
   - Suggest commit message format (e.g., `feat: complete <topic>`).

5. **AI Guidance Section**  
   - Include a section in the README where I can paste this AI prompt so the AI can **update the README automatically** with new topics, tasks, or status updates.  

6. **References & Notes**  
   - Add official Flutter links, packages references, and notes about best practices.  
   - Make it clear that this README doubles as proof of learning.

**Constraints:**  
- Use beginner-friendly language.  
- Use clear Markdown formatting with tables for the checklist.  
- Make it easy to read, track, and update.  
- Focus only on Flutter topics.  

**Output:**  
- A full, ready-to-use README file in Markdown format.
